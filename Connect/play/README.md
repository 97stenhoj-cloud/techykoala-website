# Connect Web App

⚠️ **AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY**

This folder contains the built Flutter web version of the Connect app.

## Source Code

The source code lives in: `/Users/stenhoej/Desktop/flutter_first_app`

**DO NOT** edit files in this `/Connect/play` directory directly!

## How to Update

When you make changes to the Flutter app:

```bash
# From the flutter_first_app directory:
./build_and_deploy_web.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the Flutter web app with correct base href
2. Copy the built files here
3. Tell you to commit and push

## Deployment

After running the build script:

```bash
cd /Users/stenhoej/Desktop/techykoala-website
git add Connect/play
git commit -m "Update Flutter web app"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the updated web app to:
**https://techykoala.com/Connect/play**
